## Marsh Summary

After being pulled into a whirlpool, Dad and Son find themselves in a strange place. The ground is made completely of mud, and if you stand still, you will sink infinitely down. Eventually, Son and Dad reach a door. Inside of the door is a room with four doors. Inside of every room with four doors is four more doors. It's a maze, and one that can only be defeated by reading the small, innoccuous sign at the beginning of the maze that tells you which doors to take. At the last door is an elevator. The elevator out of the Marsh, to Pacifica.

## Marsh Ideas

- Scourge Sprites which track you down and attack you based on sounds, such as footsteps
- Small, localized bursts of rain occasionally fall from the ceiling, causing scourge sprites to congregate in the area where they land
- Glow-in the dark flowers lead you to where you need to go
- Immediately after exiting the door "maze", scourge sprites burst through the door and infest the city
