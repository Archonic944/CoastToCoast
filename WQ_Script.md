\[Game opening\] A serene sunset, over a beautiful lake. Father and son are sitting side by side, feeding the ducks.

\[They feed the ducks breadcrumbs for some time. Lakeside ambiance plays\]

Son: Hey look, that duck has sunglasses on\!

Dad: Haha… maybe he’d realize he’d get more breadcrumbs that way.

\[Some time passes\]

Dad: Don’t feed them so much, okay? We’ve gotta eat too\!

Son: Wait… you aren’t gonna give me breadcrumbs for dinner again, are you?\!

Dad (surprised smile): No\! That’s not what I meant.

Son: Great\!

\[Son dumps whole bag of breadcrumbs into water. Feeding frenzy. Aggressive duck quacking noises. Nonchalant sunglasses duck simply disappears offscreen, not to be bothered.\]

Dad: Oh…

\[Some time passes. The sun sets.\]

\[Some more time passes. Son and dad are asleep. Loud “Dad Snores” play.\]

\[Screen begins to fade out. It gets to the final step of darkness, then a high pitched ringing starts to play. A blue/green beam of light shoots out from the water. The son wakes up, and the screen brightens again.\]

Son: What’s that ringing…?

Son: Maybe I should wake up dad…

Son: …

Son: Nah.

\[Son walks over to investigate. He enters the water, and bubbles start to form around him. The bubbles start swirling more and more aggressively, and the son is being pulled underwater\]

Son: What?\! They’re pulling me in\!

Son: Help\! HEEEEELP\!

\[Once Son is fully underwater, the light disappears and the ringing stops\]

Dad: Son? SON?\! SOOOOOOOOOOON\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

\[dun dun DUUUUUN\]  
\[Dad jumps into the water, screen actually fades out\]

\[Screen fades back in, the dad resurfaces\]

Dad: Dammit\! I looked everywhere\! I’d better call the- AHHHH\!\!\!

\[The bubbles swirl around Dad and pull him down, too.\]

\[Dad lands flat on his face, ungracefully, in the mud. Dark world entry sound plays\]

Dad: Where am I?

\[TITLE: THE MARSH\]

\[The marsh is the starting area. Dad walks slowly and with a squelching sound. Walk into the wrong area, and with each step, dad will sink slightly lower, almost imperceptibly so, until it is too late. After a while, you encounter a patch of light.\]

\[the ground is massive linoleum tiles. A stove, a fridge, and cabinets can be seen towering up to the sky, offscreen.\]

\[You walk around a bit and eventually encounter a giant, who throws fireballs at you and shit\]

You can:

Kill the giant, with your rifle (yes he has a rifle somehow)

* The giant falls over and you can walk on top of it, looting a couple things as well as getting a view of The City

Notice the little animal in the corner, saying “psst\! Pssst\!\! Just DANCE\!\! Like this: \[spins around 3x, then jumps twice\]”

* Giant: FI FI FO FUM\! IT’S BEEN AGES SINCE WE HAD ANY REAL ENTERTAINMENT DOWN HERE\!\! HAHAHA, YOU’RE FREE TO GO\!  
* Dad: But you were just trying to KILL ME\!\!\!  
* Giant: HA HA HA\! FORGET ABOUT IT\!  
* Dad: But you…  
* Giant: I said forget about it.

After kitchen fight:   
Giant: HELLO, LITTLE DANCER\!

Dad; So, why WERE you trying to kill me?\!

Giant: BECAUSE I GIANT\! GIANT STRONG\!\! GIANT KILL\!\!\! GIANT RIP YOUR—

Dad: O-okay\! I got it\! Chill out\!

After passing the kitchen, the camera pans up to the surface, which ripples with stars and moons.

*“Your view is no longer blocked by the sky-high ceilings of the giant’s kitchen. You catch a glimpse of a plane flying in the sky. You stare at the windows and foolishly wonder if anyone is looking back.”*
