# The Marsh

A short, experimental game made in Godot. It is precursor to a game I will make when I have more time.

Right now, the goal is to explore "The Marsh", and get to the end without drowning. Monsters roam The Marsh, and you must either avoid them, distract them, or sink in mud to save yourself (potentially endangering yourself in the process).

## Instructions

To play, simply download your binary of choice from the releases section.

WASD to move, SPACE to interact.
